# Description

## Allows you to change the brightness of the game at night.


`This mod is a client side mod, it's not needed on the server.`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

`Feel free to reach out to me on discord if you need manual download assistance.`
